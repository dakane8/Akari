# Akari
## Overview
Akari, also known as Light Up, is a logic puzzle game where players place light bulbs on a grid to illuminate all empty cells while following specific placement rules. This project was created as part of the Foundations of Programming course.\n

This project showcases my understanding of fundamental and advanced programming concepts, including:

- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Implemented using Java interfaces and classes, demonstrating encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

- Model-View-Controller (MVC) Architecture: Separation of concerns through distinct Model, View, and Controller components.

- Data Structures: Utilized arrays and lists to manage puzzle grids, lamp placements, and game states efficiently.

- Error Handling: Implemented checks for boundary conditions and illegal moves to ensure a robust and user-friendly experience.

- JavaFX UI Development: Designed an interactive graphical user interface using JavaFX, including buttons, labels, and event handling.

- Observer Pattern: Integrated observer classes to dynamically update the UI based on model changes, enhancing responsiveness.
